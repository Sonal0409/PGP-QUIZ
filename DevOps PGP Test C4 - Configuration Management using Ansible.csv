Q13,"The _ansible_syslog_facility is used to check the syslog facility ansible module logs to. You can change the syslog_facility value in ansible.cfg. Previously, we used to instantiate an AnsibleModule as:

import syslog syslog.openlog(NAME, 0, syslog.LOG_USER)
However, in newer versions like 2.1, we write it as:

import syslog facility_name = module._syslog_facility facility = getattr(syslog, facility_name, syslog.LOG_USER) syslog.openlog(NAME, 0, facility)
