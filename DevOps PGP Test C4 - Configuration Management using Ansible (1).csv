Q13,"The _ansible_syslog_facility is used to check the syslog facility ansible module logs to. You can change the syslog_facility value in ansible.cfg. Previously, we used to instantiate an AnsibleModule as:

import syslog syslog.openlog(NAME, 0, syslog.LOG_USER)
However, in newer versions like 2.1, we write it as:

import syslog facility_name = module._syslog_facility facility = getattr(syslog, facility_name, syslog.LOG_USER) syslog.openlog(NAME, 0, facility)

What could be the primary reason for this modification in the code?",The newer code is more efficient,The old code was very hacky,The old code consumes a lot of memory,The newer code runs with lessor parameters,2,

Q20,"Problem statement
Consider the given code.

- hosts: webservers 
    tasks:
